# Overview

This software is a command-line Hangman game written in the Rust programming language. Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a secret word letter by letter before running out of attempts.

I built this project to gain more familiarity and experience with the Rust programming language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
